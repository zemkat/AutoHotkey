Alma macro pack
---------------
* ctrl-D: add subfield delimiter
* alt-delete: delete a field (Connexion behavior)
* Insert: insert a field (Voyager behavior)
* F12: release a record

If you don't feel like messing with the code, you can just download one of these binaries:
* AlmaMacros-NewMDE-Chrome.exe
* AlmaMacros-NewMDE-Firefox.exe

Download and double-click to run and test. You can tell it's running if you have a little green H in your systems tray.

If you like how it's running, you can set it up to run all the time by copying the program into your Windows Startup folder (To open this folder, press the Windows logo key  + R, type shell:startup, then select OK)
